Ques1 : @JoinedColumn vs @MappedBy
Answer : 
 	@JoinColumn : The annotation @JoinColumn indicates that this entity is the owner of the relationship 
(that is: the corresponding table has a column with a foreign key to the referenced table)

	@MappedBy : mappedBy indicates that the entity in this side is the inverse of the relationship,and the owner resides in 
			the "other" entity. This also means that you can access the other table 
			from the class which you've annotated with "mappedBy" (fully bidirectional relationship).

Ques2 : orderItems.add(item);
            item.setOrder(this);    what is use of passing this as a argument 

Ans : The keyword this may be used only in the body of an instance method,
 instance initializer or constructor, or in the initializer of an instance variable of a class.
 If it appears anywhere else, a compile-time error occurs. When used as a primary expression,
 the keyword this denotes a value that is a reference to the object for which the instance method was invoked (ยง15.12), 
or to the object being constructed. The type of this is the class C within which the keyword this occurs.
 At run time, the class of the actual object referred to may be the class C or any subclass of C.
